Ola budding computational material researchers out there! 

This repo contains codes to simulate growth of a single precipitate using phase field modeling. 
You can also take it as an example for solving partial differential equations by transforming them into Fourier space using FFTW package.  

'WithoutElasticity' folder contains code to simulate the growth without considering coherency strains.
'WithElasticity' folder contains code to simulate the growth while considering coherency strains between the matrix and precipitate phase.

You can run the code in linux terminal using the following command: 
gcc evo.c -lm -lfftw3 -lfftw3_threads -lpthread

The code will generate .txt files containing composition matrix at the output time step. Use gnuplot to generate color plots of the same.

Refer the wiki for more info.
